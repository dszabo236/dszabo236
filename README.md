### Welcome to my Github!

My name is Dani, and I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia. I consider myself proficient in Java and C++, and I'm familiar with C, x86 assembly, Python, and HTML.

All of my school-related code is in a private repository to comply with UVA's honor policy, but I am happy to share my code portfolio with people interested in checking it out - please shoot me an email at ds6wqt@virginia.edu and I can share it with you or send you it in a zipped folder.

Otherwise, feel free to check out my other projects.
