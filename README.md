### Welcome to my Github!

<!--
**dszabo236/dszabo236** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Dani, and I'm currently a student at the University of Virginia. I consider myself proficient in Java, and C++, and I dabble in C and x86 assembly. All of my school-related code is in a private repository to comply with UVA's honor policy, but I am happy to share my code portfolio with people interested in checking it out - please shoot me an email at ds6wqt@virginia.edu and I can share it with you or send you it in a zipped folder.

Otherwise, feel free to check out my other projects.
